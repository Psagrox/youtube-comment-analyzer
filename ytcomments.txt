a perfect escape from reality. grateful for the peace it brings.
it&#39;s very peculiar how many of the commenters here have anime children as their profile pictures.
listening to this feels like escaping reality
perfect for winding down after a long day.
the visuals and sound aesthetics are pure art! can’t stop listening. like it if you agree! 🎨🎶&quot;
can y&#39;all support my own lofi as well
life is tough yet you are still here<br>have a nice day<br>good luck ahead<br>don&#39;t give up
slv dry onde tu estiver eu tô muito mal eu preciso de ti
i&#39;m trying to stand up for myself and be a better version of me. this week i&#39;ve been feeling the most proud of myself in many many months or even years
i&#39;m introvert. lising to this music makes me want to contribute to human for once
hope everyone is doing well!<br>and if you&#39;re not, i hope this comment cheers you up at least a little <br><br>make sure to stay hydrated, eat plenty of food, and know that i believe in you! live your life the best you can every day!<br>&lt;3 ily all!
hey there, can you tell me if i can get this wallpaper and if soo, where? have a great day
to whoever is reading this, may your path be paved with positivity, and may every dream you chase become a reality.
yall have me bawling 😫
bebeu se fodeu qulsuaa idade

lofi&#39;s simplicity carries profound emotional resonance. the unassuming nature of the music allows listeners to connect with its raw, emotive qualities. whether feeling nostalgic, stressed, or content, lofi has a unique ability to mirror and amplify our emotions.
que fofo ❤️
like lofi girl, best song for study/relaxing
bro i had the most intense crying session because i realized how much god did and sacrificed for me. i’m good now tho but dang y’all jesus christ is amazing and god loves you so put faith in him✌️😁
some people find that lofi music enhances their creativity and focus.
hello :)<br>i want to do something here, every year i&#39;ll stop by here in the comments while listening and relaxing and list all the years i&#39;ve gone through. yes, every year, and i promise i wont forget about it. i<br><br><br>2023: (not complete)
perfect playlist for the winter. it&#39;s summer now where i live but i&#39;ll keep these songs for the next brutal winter.
love this bootletboy❤
your lofi playlists are really nice to listen to and the visuals are always really pretty &lt;33
don&#39;t worry bamboo very strong 😅
better work quality<br>less stress<br>more time to work on strategic or creative projects<br>less procrastination<br>more self-confidence<br>here’s how to get started: remember be yourself because everybody else is taken
thứ tôi làm khi nghe playlist này: skincare sau khi đi học về :)
&quot;if you&#39;re sad eat good food&quot;
essa playlist me dá uma sensação de nostalgia tão boa, lembro de quando eu escutava em 2020/2021 lendo manga
imagine playing this lofi song in a rainy new york city and a comfy bed

comme une rivière plongée dans le silence qui n&#39;entend plus la mélodie de l&#39;eau.<br>comme un sommet gris en hiver qui a vu fondre son dernier flocon il y a de cela plusieurs printemps.<br>comme une terre sans parfum qui ne peut que se rappeler de l&#39;odeur des fleurs.<br>comme un grain de sable fade qui ne goutera plus jamais à l&#39;écume.<br>comme eux je veux rien qu&#39;une fois pouvoir te prendre dans mes bras.

“she’s not mine anymore, yet it still hurts to see her leave again”
the sprite beverage looks fantastic
muito bom

bro i love your song and i like and subscribe i lisent to you all the time!
am i high or there&#39;re some discord notification sounds in the 6th song?
dope playlist
hey guys
types of comments under every lofi video:<br>1. people wishing strangers a nice day<br>2. 100 reasons to stay alive<br>3. people sharing what small successes they achieved today<br>4. people describing cute and relaxing activities to listen lofi to<br>5. people being positively surprised how supportive the lofi community is
&quot;even i saw you 100 times, you just a stranger passing by&quot;
i really love your lo fi playlist
i love it
listening to this while studying and it&#39;s raining, is the calmest thing ever
lofi rhythm is extremely relaxing: take your time, relax, and be silent
lovely mix! really helps me study and not stress too much 🤗
to everyone who&#39;s studying with this music:<br>checklist: <br>• a bottle of water, at least 1liter. your brain works better if it has enough water and drinking helps you to concentrate💧<br><br>• your charger. you sometimes don&#39;t even notice that your device&#39;s battery is going down, so better have it plugged in all the time🔋<br><br>• your headphones. you will be able to focus more with headphones, because it blocks background noises. also, if it&#39;s a late night study session, you won&#39;t wake up anyone🎧<br><br>• a tea or coffee. coffee keeps you awake, green or black tea can make you feel more awake as well.☕<br><br>• your study/work stuff:  your laptop/tablet/phone , a few pens, paper or whatever you need.⌨<br><br>•anything else you could need, what about a heat pad, a blanket, a good lamp, your pet so you have a study buddy 🐈<br><br><br>reminder:after an hour, you should stand up and walk a bit around. better stop the music or put on different music for the break. open your window, even if it&#39;s cold outside. fresh air will make it better, trust me. <br>you could also lay your head down on your desk for ten minutes and listen to a podcast. or, if you have to read a book, listen to the audiobook of it. you can also listen to the audiobook while doing another thing, that&#39;s even better than listening to music while reading the book.<br><br>i hope y&#39;all had a good day, if not, that&#39;s okay too. remember to take care of yourself and try to get some sleep tonight <br><br>( this comment isn&#39;t originally mine, but i think it can help a lot of people :)
epico, me muero de frio pero epico 👌
it’s funny<br>there are so many lonely people in the world and we still can’t find each other
god, summer can’t come soon enough
im listening to this on a very cold day, studying all alone at my university`s cafeteria because no one wanted to accompany me. the topic (physiology of the lungs) can be very challenging and dry but a hot cup of coffee and this playlist makes it more bearable :) thank you
i ❤ lofi..
listening while drinking sprite :) i love soda. especially with lofi, brings you to an entirely different realm of peace an relaxation
i was just rickrolled by an ad
just laying down on my bed and vibing
lo-fi como lenguaje universal para personas relajadas tratando de abandonar esta dimensión

i love this song it&#39;s make me happy 😁
hey guys! if you&#39;re reading this and just overall having a bad time in life, i promise it&#39;ll get better. rest up, drink some water, eat, and just sit down and take a break from life. happiness is temporary but so is stress, so please try to live up to what you wanna do in life, because you control your body, mind, and feelings. and if you&#39;re not having a bad time, just try to help those people who need help!
hay lắm!
cool
devil: i will invade and never leave your mind.<br>lofi: omae wa mou shindeiru.<br>devil: nani!<br>me: thanks lofi.

escutar isso na madrugada é a melhor coisa,confia
i&#39;ve seen other people do this, wanted to try it out.<br>i&#39;m gonna update this most of the times that i see it :)<br><br>july 26, 2021<br>jeez. the world has been in a state of chaos. covid, a virus which is infecting many of our population has changed the world as i know it. i&#39;m not that old. i&#39;m supposed to be outside with my friends, laughing and eating snacks. the sun is shining outside, the window almost looks....ethereal. who am i kidding? most people don&#39;t understand how i feel during the hours before the sun sets, listening to lofi. it just feels magical.<br><br>maybe you do. you are special, after all.<br><br>july 27, 2021<br>hi. how are you doing? i hope that you feel well. me? i&#39;m doing fine.<br><br>august 2, 2021<br>summer&#39;s over, huh?<br><br>october 17, 2021<br>i miss my co-authors. they&#39;re busy in life right now, i guess we all are. sometimes i wonder what life would be like if we could take even a few hours to relax without having to worry about anything.
best song to listen when inside a &quot;freezer&quot;
me: is sleeping peacefully<br>youtube:haha ads go brrrrrrrr
now this is my favorite relaxing songs
the person talking sounded so sad like can i give u a hug r u ok?
i&#39;m literally freezing rn and i&#39;m in my heaviest jacket.
music is powerful and can take you into another mental stage...your mind is the limit to where you want to be!
pls tell me this is free to use? :)
i really love the metaphor, the wings symbolizing our dreams and revealing it makes people laugh at us. but there&#39;s always that one reason, or person, that inspires us to pursue what we love and fly. lmao i&#39;m  into music as damn this fire ❤
what about copy right
o
i feel like my parents wasted money on me, don&#39;t want a nice and cute guy to waste his time on me. so i stay away from people. this music keeps me company...so at least i have something by my side
don’t jugde  people for how they are on the oustside, judge them on the inside
thank you for realizing how hard life is
title say about the cold days.. its summer yet my soul is colder than ever.
hi there, if you&#39;re reading. just know that you will go through all of this. it wouldn&#39;t be easy but you&#39;ll get there. and despite all tough moments you had, there&#39;s always someone who love you dearly no matter what. you are amazing and gorgeous and beautiful and handsome and proud of you making it till this day :) hope you&#39;ll enjoy your day
just perfect
waw that good lofi

im sad but i have no reason to, so now i just feel guilty..
the voice in the beginning it&#39;s similar to mine😲😲😨
i was diagnosed with clinical depression 8 months ago and i gotta say this. this guy, his music helped me through them... whenever i felt sad or giving up i just listened to his music. so a big thank you to you,bootleg boy.
i feel like there are so many different kinds of lofi  but this is my kind. ( i dont know if this counts as lofi but i also like shiloh )

pov: you&#39;re in bed at night while the ac is running

this song is good
at this point i don&#39;t know what to do with life
2021:done<br>2022:<br>2023:<br>2024:<br>2025:
people who are listening to lofi are honestly the most wholesome people i have ever met.<br><br>they might be the quiet kid who love to spend time in a quite place or the aggressive kid with a hidden soft taste.
hello

thanks for this. is the better
im gonna go back here:<br>2020:✓<br>2021:✓<br>2022:<br>2023:<br>2024:<br>2025:
the start of this video hurt my heart, it’s been a while, and he does this randomly, i’m scared he’s going through something and he doesn’t trust me enough to tell me, i’m waiting for a call from him to see if he’s alright. it hurts because every time his excuse is “i’m sorry i was busy”, i don’t know if he’s isolating himself because i’m also a pretty messed up mentally unstable person and it breaks me. i just want him to be okay, 7 years of friendship and i can’t lose him.
27 december is my happy birday i for argentina
i have a sudden craving for sprite.
just perfect..
love
i’m alone again...naturally
i like to consider this a sleep playlist, it’s soo calm✨
doing suicide doesn&#39;t take off pain, <b>it gives it to someone else</b>
the first 35 seconds are the best part of the video
its 8:43 am and im numb, my gf is going through a horrible time and i had a panic attack. this is helping, thank you
this is the playlist of my life
im on a hand made swing out in nature it’s relaxing

thank you for this 😋. i just wanna say, that jesus christ saves you. if you feel empty, it&#39;s because you need him. just ,,believing in god&quot; don&#39;t save you. you have to accept christ as your savior and be born again . love you guys 🫂🙏🏻💕.
i wish there was a way to know that you&#39;re in the good old days before you actually left them.

everyone talking about how this cheers them up while me on the other hand and uses the audio 👀
it snowing where i live and this makes it better
sighhhhh...💔😞
is there such thing as a sprite light?
i just wanna tell you guys that... <br><br><br>your worth it
freaking cold in texas💀
hey uhm, this is a note to myself so feel free to sit along this crazy ride with me.<br><br>i’m a lost person from a place that has everything planned out. everyone knows what they want to do, who they are, and what the want. i’m stuck between what i am. people say i have time to figure out myself but how am i supposed to go this long knowing nothing. i want to know who i am. maybe it’d be easier to be without my family. they degrade me when i take the wrong step. i just remember that most of this is my fault. at least i can try to keep a smile. something to warm up my days would be great. i can always try my best to figure out who i am but, i’ll get scared the moment i try. it’ll work out though. i hope so at least. <br><br>for all of those whom read this and feel the same way, keep your chin up. things will turn out just fine. we’ll be okay. somethings might not be the best right now but they will soon. stay safe, hun.💕
fun fact: you can&#39;t breathe and smile at the same time<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>haha got u! i just wanted to see that beautiful smile of yours ༼ つ ◕◡◕ ༽つ♡︎
yah cool, but did you know you could save 15 mins for 15% off with geico insurance.
lo fi on lonely days?? yessir

listening to this reminds me of those school bus and the talks that we used to have, ranging from movies to certain teacher. i was just a distant friend for her, but she meant something for me, more than a crush. i regret not telling her my feelings and now, she&#39;s in a ldr with someone. earlier, it used to pierce my heart, but now, i think i have started making peace with the truth. i feel lonely whenever i think of her, but now, all thanks to the lofi and especially the comment section here, i feel comfortable.<br>sorry for a long rant, and if you&#39;ve read this whole passage, then thanks for reading.<br>stay safe. :)

я думаю, что для многих людей профессия врача является самой нужной. каждый из нас, хоть раз в жизни, но нуждался во врачебной помощи. если бы не было людей этой благородной профессии, то люди бы болели и, не получая медицинской помощи, умирали.

this gives me life.
is it just me who&#39;s just here to chill with espresso and no depresso?
lol winter timee
i just clicked on that video because i like lofi and it is indeed a cold day. but i see a lot of sad peeps here in the comments. so, to all the sad peeps: i hear you, i understand you, but remember that it will be ok, it will pass. you might feel depressed and alone now because that&#39;s just where you are in life at the moment. its a sad chapter, but trust me, the happy chapter isn&#39;t far and it will come. no joke, i though my happy chapter would never come. life is hard but totally worth it. i have ptsd(bad childhood trauma), depression, crippeling anxiety, you name it! but in the midst of <b>literally</b> being forced to work on myself and face the demons of my life (because my brain just decided it was time for me to work on it lol) i found hope. because i am finally starting to get my life together, i am finally in a place that doesn&#39;t make me feel like i am the problem, i am finally starting my happy chapter!! so to all of you who have been reading this far; if i would have &quot;ended&quot; myself in my teens, if i wouldn&#39;t have been so resilient and so strong, i would have never experienced happiness, real true love for my self and mostly i wouldn&#39;t have been able to give myself the life i truly deserve. so, hang in there, your time will come and you will shine! you just have to be patient and believe it&#39;s possible, because it is possible. i believe in you and i love you xoxo life is worth it even if it sucks sometimes but it is totally worth it.

love this!.. guys if u have time check my beats too thanks :)
imagine listening to this on those cold winter days, its not snowy out but it feels like its gonna snow. the cold air is crisp and clear outside, when you breathe in  you feel a stinging sensation from the icey cold air.  you get inside your warm cozy home just to see your dog, cat (pet) to greet you. you&#39;ve had a long stressful day at work and you need a break from everything for a bit. you get the fireplace going. you grab a cup of hot chocolate and your laptop, you plop down on the couch that&#39;s right next to the fireplace. you then plug in some headphones to your laptop and start listening to   some lofi-hiphop, you then realize your pet has fallen asleep on your lap. you lay there on the ouch for hours thinking about life and what makes you happy. you then start to drift off into dream land. you think to yourself &quot;i deserve this.&quot;
i am trying to find a reason behind this cycle of waking up, eating, switching tabs between class and video games. i feel as if i am in a waiting room and i don&#39;t even have an appointment. i want to do something with my life, i want to be next to him, but most of all i want to know that everything will work itself out and i have more to live coming up than what i can currently see. i wish i could peer into a looking glass and see myself happy with my boyfriend and maybe a cat...i don&#39;t long for many things in life, but i just want to be okay. i want to know that everything will start to pick up and that one day i will feel in place with myself and everything around me. i&#39;m sick of being in neutral with the motor running. i&#39;m sick of this waiting room. i&#39;m tired of this waiting room.  this impendent dread will hopefully end one day soon, maybe sooner than i know...but all that i know is that everything will be fine next to you.
i thought the intro&#39;s voice was mark lee from nct 🥺
back to listening to lofi with sad thoughts/: it’s been awhile
break a leg boy strikes again! thanks bro! 💜

no hate but, it seems on all lofi songs there are comments about how you should feel loved and to not kill yourself... bruh im just listening to some music
yes break ups hurt,<br>but have you wiped your ass for the 20th time and there&#39;s still poop on the toilet paper
it&#39;s a terrible day for rain

theres this boy i like, ive only liked him for a few days now, we&#39;ve known each other for years tho, we stay up till 6am on discord call just talking and playing music, i could hear his voice for hours and hours and wouldnt get tired, but i know he&#39;ll never like me, a this friendship is better then no friendship right? it hurts so much that i cant tell him. but better then nothing, so thats why im here, i feel lonely without him.
love is the reason <b><i>why there is pain.</i></b>
lonely again peeps! but it be like that i suppose. someday wont be forever.
as always during listening lo-fi im checking the comment section to read all your comments its now my hobbit thank you bootleg boy thank you all for everything

still keeping me happy through some dark times p.s have a good new year
such a great mix my friend!
funny how the lonely feelings that bring us all here together ends up making us feel less lonely in the end.

this comment may get lost with the many other inspiring comments, but if you&#39;re reading this, i wish nothing but the best for you. remember &quot;normal&quot; is just a word, it is okay to feel sad, mad, happy, lost, etc. at the end of the day, you are you and society has no control over it! realize you&#39;re strong, independent, tough, and seize the day for what it is, a new opportunity! subscribe if you felt this comment, i mean every part of this post, but need to grow as well!
if u see this comment shout e out in next vid pls i liked and subbed :)

with tears streaming down my cheeks, i listen to this.. i miss my mom so much, i miss the old me so much, i don&#39;t know how much longer i have to crawl out from this deep empty hole...

finally is so cold here and ive been listening for the hot days- ironic amirite?
my brother took my heater so my is cold now
merry christmas everyone
it’s 2am and i’m getting lean. i’m so tired lonely and bored.
its been late. havent sleep and i feel.. nothing? i̇ donnow whats wrong with me
a broken heart never gets stronger
it is 7 degrees where i live in europe rn (it has been unbearably cold since a few days before christmas) and i haven&#39;t felt the sun&#39;s warmth ever since 6th of december because i got quarantined and boi let me tell you i am lacking vitamin d and serotonin
your the best 💜 thank you for sharing my song!
i just want to vent here really quick :)<br>lately, due to quarantine and coronavirus, i haven&#39;t been seeing anybody besides family, and by family i mean my dad, mom, sister, and stepdad, and stepmom.<br>i was already terrible at socializing, not to mention it drains my energy. but it only drained when i was talking to people.<br>now, whenever i&#39;m around people, i feel lazy, hopeless, unenergized, and i&#39;m put into a bad mood. whenever someone talks to me, i&#39;m easily angered. in these times, i&#39;m also quite sensitive, which isn&#39;t normal for me.<br>i&#39;m seeing a therapist, but not for the same reason. i&#39;ve also only been to two sessions, and we&#39;ve only been getting to know each other. <br>something that would make me feel better is talking to my friends, but before quarantine i was a whole other person. i really want to ditch them for someone i can really engage with, but there&#39;s no one else i can go to. <br>i&#39;ve been drifting away from them either way. <br>venting usually makes me feel a lot better, but none of them understand how painful and how much what i&#39;m going through impacts me. <br>i can&#39;t blame them, but it&#39;s really tearing me apart.<br><br>if you&#39;re reading this, thank you for listening. i love you. you are worth it no matter what. good night.
came out just in time
hi! ive been subbed for a long time and i love your vids :) im starting to stream in the new year and i was wondering of youd be comfortable with me playing the audios in the background? (with credit ofc) if not, that’s completely fine, i thought id ask though :)
yo whoever is reading this, it’s ok if you’re feeling sad. just remember that it doesn’t last forever. even if you can’t remember a time when you weren’t down, i know that there was at least one second in your life when you were something close to happy. i really hope that you can experience that feeling again, but for a longer time. if you need to talk, please talk to me in the replies. i am here for you; we have to stick together for each other. i love you❤️
